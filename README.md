# Java Programming Notes

## Introduction
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications.

## Key Features
- **Platform Independent**: Write once, run anywhere (WORA).
- **Object-Oriented**: Supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Robust**: Strong memory management and exception handling.
- **Secure**: Provides a secure runtime environment.

## Basic Syntax
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Common Topics
1. **Data Types**: int, float, char, boolean, etc.
2. **Control Statements**: if-else, switch, loops (for, while, do-while).
3. **OOP Concepts**: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation.
4. **Collections Framework**: List, Set, Map, etc.
5. **Exception Handling**: try, catch, finally, throw, throws.
6. **Multithreading**: Thread class, Runnable interface, synchronization.
